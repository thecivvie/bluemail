!
!

!bitmap:            the name of a valid pixmap file of depth 1 used for
!                   the application's icon
!                   Default:        a 32x32 or 64x64 pixmap depending on the
!                                   window manager
!
!translations:      Translations enable the user to customise the action
!                   that occurs when a key, combination of keys, or a button
!                   is pressed. The translations in XCurses are similar in
!                   function and definition to translations used by xterm.
!                   Defaults:
!                     <Key>:                    XCursesKeyPress()
!                     <Btn1Down>:               XCursesButton()
!                     !Ctrl <Btn2Down>:         XCursesButton()
!                     <Btn2Down>,<Btn2Up>:      XCursesPasteSelection()
!                     <Btn3Down>:               XCursesButton()
!                     <Btn1Up>:                 XCursesButton()
!                     <Btn3Up>:                 XCursesButton()
!                     <BtnMotion>:              XCursesButton()
!
!                   The most useful action for KeyPress translations is
!                   string(). The argument to the string() action can be
!                   either a string or a hex representation of a character,
!                   eg. string(0x1b) will result in the ASCII escape
!                   character to be sent to the XCurses application.
!                   string("[11~") will result in [ 1 1 ~ being sent, as
!                   seperate keystokes to the XCurses application.
!
!shmmin:            On most systems, there are two Unix kernel parameters that
!                   determine the allowable size of a shared memory segment.
!                   These parameters are usually something like SHMMIN and
!                   SHMMAX. To use shared memory, a program must allocate a
!                   segment of shared memory that is between these two
!                   values. Usually these values are like 1 for SHMMIN and
!                   some large number for SHMMAX. Sometimes the Unix kernel
!                   is configured to have a value of SHMMIN that is bigger
!                   than the size of one of the shared memory segments that
!                   XCurses uses. On these systems an error message like:
!
!                     Cannot allocate shared memory for SCREEN: Invalid argument
!
!                   will result. To overcome this problem, this XCurses
!                   resource should be set to the kernel value for SHMMIN.
!                   This ensures that a shared memory segment will always be
!                   bigger than the kernel value for SHMMIN (and hopefully
!                   less than SHMMAX!)
!                   Default:        0
!
!borderColor:       the colour of the border around the screen
!                   Default:        Black
!
!borderWidth:       the width in pixels of the border around the screen
!                   Default:        0
!
!clickPeriod:       the period (in milliseconds) between a button press
!                   and a button release that determines if a click of a
!                   button has occurred
!                   Default:        100
!
!doubleClickPeriod: the period (in milliseconds) between two button
!                   press events that determines if a double click
!                   of a button has occurred
!                   Default:        200
!
!composeKey:        the name of the X key that defines the "compose key" which
!                   is used to enter characters in the Latin-1 character set
!                   above 0xA0.
!                   Generally this key will be one of the X "modifier" keys,
!                   like Alt_L, Meta_R etc. but can be a "normal" key like
!                   F1. While in "compose key" mode, the text cursor will
!                   appear as a hollow rectangle.
!                   Default:        No key is defined
