blueMail installation procedure
===============================

1. Make sure any needed packages are installed.

    In addition to the blueMail package itself, you'll also need InfoZip
    (and/or LHA, ARJ, etc.) to uncompress the packets and compress the
    replies when using the offline mail packet service. You can get InfoZip
    at:

    ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/src

    In DOS, you can use PKZIP instead of InfoZip.

    To compile blueMail, you'll need curses -- either ncurses, SysV
    curses (e.g., Solaris curses), or PDCurses. You can get ncurses from:

    http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html

    PDCurses is available at:

    http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net

    If you want to compile blueMail with option WITH_CLOCK and a PDCurses
    version prior to 2.6, you must patch PDCurses first, because the
    official releases had a bug with the halfdelay() input function needed
    for the clock. You can get a patch from:

    http://home.wtal.de/ib/bluemail

    (If you're using Linux, you may already have ncurses and InfoZip.)
    Also, bear in mind that blueMail needs the C++ standard libraries,
    not just C.

2. Configure it (for compilation).

    Check the paths at the top of the Makefile.inc (for installation) and
    go thru the section appropriate to your operating system (a short
    explanation can be found at the end of the Linux section which is used
    as default).
    If you want to omit one or more specific drivers (i.e. if you want
    blueMail not to be able to handle all mail types in order to have a
    smaller executable), edit bluemail/driverl.h and delete the lines
    describing the drivers you want to omit.

3. Compile blueMail.

    At the base directory, type: make

4. Run it.

    Type: ./bmail
    (For DOS, Windows or OS/2, set the BMAIL or HOME variable, then run
    bmail.)

5. (Optional:) Configure it (for end user).

    Edit the ~/.bmailrc file.
    (For DOS or OS/2, bmail.rc.)
    Please have a look into the man page (bmailrc.5, or bmailrc.txt for DOS,
    Windows or OS/2) or history file whether there are new options/keywords
    since the last version.

    Hint: Set all the miscellaneous options to `yes' to get all features
    available.

6. (Optional:) Install it system-wide.

    Type: make install
    This will install the binaries in BINDIR, the manuals in MAN1DIR and
    MAN5DIR, and some useful example stuff in DOCDIR/bmail/examples.
    (Requires root access and does not work in DOS, Windows or OS/2.
    If you need automatic installation in DOS, Windows or OS/2, create a
    batch file named bmail.bat which copies or moves the binaries into an
    appropriate directory. Typing "make dos" will call bmail.bat with
    parameter /install.)

    There are icons suitable for Windows (bmail.ico) and Unix (bmail.png) in
    the misc directory.

7. (Optional:) Test it with the demo driver.

    If you'd like to test blueMail, use the demo service.

    If you'd like to test the offline mail packet service, but have no
    offline mail packet, you can use a demo packet (an empty file, size 0
    named demo.pkt packed into an archive). You can create an appropriate
    archive by yourself or use demo.pkt which can be found in the misc
    directory.

    blueMail has a special, built-in demo driver which handles both service
    and packet. The demo driver generates an area and messages which allows
    you to get a first impression of blueMail (but not to test all blueMail
    features).

See the man page (bmail.1, or bmail.txt for DOS, Windows or OS/2) and README
for more information, as well as the misc directory for some useful script
and batch files.
